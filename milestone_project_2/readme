This milestone project is a recreation of game called "War" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game))
The objective of game is to win all cards.
Two players evenly divide the deck of 52 cards.
Then every player reveals the top card of their deck. The player who revealed a higher card,
takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.
If both cards are of the same value, then there is a "war":
both players put aside next three cards face down and reveal next card. The owner of the higher face-up card takes
all 8 cards (two cards face-up and six cards face-down).
Game ends when one of the players loose all their cards.
